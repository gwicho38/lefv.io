# Our Consent is Not Freely Given

> 2025.04.23

Civil disobedience is a corollary of maintaining free societies; in turn, keeping our societies free.
For the select groups in our society that seek to subjugate, compliance is not just given, but expected.
This expectation fuels the cycle of violence that leads to capitulation. At least, that's what I experienced
during my childhood in Cuba.

For those of us not on that island, the sheer weight and power of a populace turned against its subjugators
is willfully ignored by the oppressors and those seeking to possess. Unfortunately for them, willful ignorance
will not help them on the hangman's noose.
