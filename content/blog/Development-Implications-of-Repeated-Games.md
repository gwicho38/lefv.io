**The Development Implications of the Prisoner's Dilemma**

Law and Development

Luis Fernández de la Vara

**Abstract**

*This paper analyzes how the prisoner's dilemma can be used as a model
to create social structures that align individual with group incentives.
In particular it applies the cooperative benefits that are accrued after
repeated rounds of the prisoner's dilemma to different social structures
of hunter-gathering, agrarian, and industrial societies. It concludes
that hunter-gathering societies were probably the most effective at
obtaining cooperation from individuals in the face of their natural
incentive to deviate, and that social complexity is positively related
to individual incentive to deviate. The implication that follows is that
development theories, of any kind, may be able to increase beneficial
outcomes by creating regimes that bolster individual cooperation.*

# Introduction

In the 21^st^ century humanity has attained unprecedented levels of
development. As a species we are now capable of growing limbs and
finding primordial gravitational waves. The year 2014 marks a period in
the history of mankind when, for most people, starvation, sickness, and
poverty seem to be drifting into the distant past.[^1] Yet for many
people, all of this progress has failed to eradicate problems common ten
thousand years ago.

This glaring disparity in human wealth, progress, and innovation serves
as the foundation for most development theories. Some scholars attribute
this disparity in wealth and outcomes to imperialism, hub-and-spoke, and
core-periphery economic models.[^2] Others claim that property rights,
religion, and work ethic are the panacea.[^3] Recently, institutional
development theories have claimed that a mixture of organizations,
rules, and outcomes combine to make up institutions, and that
institutions are causal or necessary in fostering sustainable
development.[^4]

Regardless of the proposed solution, one common theme across all of
these development theories is that social structures play a pivotal role
in economic growth, independent of resources and population.[^5]
Further, there is general agreement that, where individuals do not have
positive incentive structures guiding their decision-making,
socioeconomic wellbeing tends to suffer. Is it possible, then, that
development theories can all be valid as long as they emphasize certain
factors that will promote a reversion to better incentive structures?

Using game theory and the prisoner's dilemma, this paper will attempt to
create a model to analyze incentive structures in various prototypical
societies for their ability to minimize an individual's incentive to
deviate. In doing so this paper will argue that, when analyzed through
the framework of game theory and the prisoner's dilemma (1) development
programs that minimize individual incentives to deviate can be
successful in fostering sustainable economic growth and (2) when this
framework is applied to social structures at different epochs---namely
hunter-gathering, agrarian, and industrial societies---both hunter
gathering societies and agrarian societies were much better at
minimizing individual incentives to deviate than industrial societies.

The paper then examines a particular development scheme---solidarity
lending in microfinance---and argues that part of its success can be
explained by the fact that it borrows from hunter-gathering and agrarian
incentive structures. Although the results of the application of the
model created herein are mixed this paper hopes add to law and
development scholarship by emphasizing the importance of incentive
structures in development policies.

# Analytical Framework

This paper will employ lessons from game theory and the prisoner's
dilemma. It will use these models to analyze different social structures
for their ability to minimize an individual's incentive to deviate. The
prisoner's dilemma is often used as a model for situations involving
cooperative behavior.[^6] Though minimizing the individual incentive to
deviate often maximizes group welfare by increasing group surplus, the
prisoner's dilemma explains why, when faced with choosing between
cooperative and deviant behavior, individuals will rationally pursue
their self-interest. This is less than optimal, with the outcome being
worse for society than if the individual had cooperated.

A typical formulation of the prisoner's dilemma is as follows:

> Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each
> prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of speaking to or
> exchanging messages with the other. The police admit that they do not
> have enough evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge. They
> instead plan to sentence both to a year in prison on a lesser charge.
> Simultaneously, the police offer each prisoner a bargain. Each
> prisoner is given the opportunity to either betray the other, by
> testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with
> the other by remaining silent.
>
> A typical prisoner's dilemma payoff matrix is as follows. If A and B
> both betray the other, then each of them serves two years in prison
> (with a payoff of 1 each). If A betrays B but B remains silent, then A
> will be set free and B will serve 3 years in prison (and vice
> versa---with a payoff of 4 for the deviator). If both A and B remain
> silent, both of them will only serve 1 year in prison (with a payoff
> of 2 each). The problem is illustrated in normal form below:
>
> ![](media/image1.png){width="3.803472222222222in" height="3.25in"}
>
> In a one-shot game, it is implied that the prisoners will not have an
> opportunity to punish each other with repeated play and that their
> decisions will not affect their reputation in the future. The result
> is that betraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating
> with them. Therefore the only possible outcome for two purely rational
> prisoners is for them to betray each other. Sadly, coordination would
> have resulted in the best net gain for the prisoners (in terms of less
> years in jail), but the incentive to deviate is strong.[^7]

The prisoner's dilemma covers a wide range of situations, but it is
important to note that where players have repeated interactions, they
also have the ability to punish deviants. The case of repeated
interactions introduces important analytical elements that will play a
pivotal role in analyzing social incentive structures.[^8] First,
repeated games introduce the concept of "N," or the number of times a
particular player plays a certain game (rounds).[^9] Second, repeated
games also introduce the concept of ∂, or impatience. ∂ captures the
fact that individual behavior over a certain number of rounds, or N,
will tend to be more or less cooperative depending on how much an
individual values future outcomes (or fears punishment for deviation).

In applying the analytic model this paper will also make two assumptions
regarding N and ∂.[^10] First, individuals living in societies approach
social interactions as a series of games. The number of times the
individual expects to play a certain game will be described by the
capital letter "N." N can include any number between one and infinity.
The more an individual expects to play a certain game, the higher the N.
The higher the N, the more likely the individual will cooperate. This
assumption is key because it runs counter to the classic solution for
finite games, where the prisoner's dilemma would predict deviation.[^11]
This paper will assume that an individual with an N of less than
infinity will still wish to cooperate despite individual short-term
incentives to deviate.[^12]

The second assumption incorporated by the model is that individuals
discount the future payoff and punishment for future
cooperation/deviance by a certain, implicit, discount factor. This
discount factor will be referred to through this paper by the Greek
letter ∂. The future discount factor, ∂, has been defined in many ways,
often as the implicit interest rate.[^13] Defining ∂ as the interest
rate will be an unnecessary complication for purposes of this paper;
therefore I've chosen to define ∂ as being a function of social
punishment regimes. That is, the better the societies are at punishing
deviant behavior, the lower ∂ drops, and the more patient an individual
becomes. Borrowing somewhat from typical interest rate formulations, ∂
can also be expressed as a parameter where 0 ≤ ∂ ≤ 1. Future punishment
is discounted by ∂ as described by the expression
$\frac{1}{{(1 + \partial)}^{t}}$. This expression essentially states
that with a ∂ of zero, an individual will value the future as much as
the present, and a ∂ of 1 means that the individual values the future
half as much of the present. The expression reflects how punishment
makes individuals more patient. More patient individuals are more likely
to cooperate than they are to deviate.

The analytical structure would be incomplete without describing certain
factors that could affect N and ∂, respectively. Assuming that N is the
number of expected rounds, it will be affected by the standard of living
in a particular society,[^14] the social welfare structures,[^15] the
degree of social interdependence,[^16] and political structures.[^17]
For example, an individual who lives in a society with a relatively low
standard of living, and a high probability of imminent death would
likely have a low N, because that person has few expected rounds
remaining. The effect of the decrease is that individual's low N will
reflect a higher propensity to deviate from cooperative interactions.

Given a particular number of rounds (N), the same factors that were used
in analyzing N may also determine ∂, where ∂ will be a decreasing
function of the degree to which an individual fears punishment.[^18] It
could alternatively be thought of as an individual's belief in the
quality of her future.[^19] For example, all else equal, a society that
is very small has an easier time punishing activities that run contrary
to social norms.[^20] This informs a particular individual's belief that
society will punish deviant activity in the future. This realization
will in turn cause the individual to value present cooperation more
highly than if the punishment was weak.[^21]

An example of a typical interaction that will be analyzed in this paper
is the kinship structure of hunter-gathering societies. Generally,
kinship social structures of hunter-gatherers require that once a
certain individual marries, that individual will form a new unit with
his or her partner, and often the partner's extended family. In the
context of the analytical model laid out above, the kinship structure
affects both N and ∂. This kinship structure increases N because the
individual's ties to a larger group through marriage make that
individual more susceptible to the cooperative pressures of that social
group. At the same time, this individual's ∂ will decrease, since
family, in the context of hunter-gatherers, also requires an individual
to search for food with the collective in mind.[^22] The interplay
between these two factors mean that where an individual faces a
situation where he or she has an incentive to deviate (e.g., not use
optimal effort when hunting or when killing certain enemies), all else
equal, the married individual will have a greater incentive to
cooperate.

This paper notes that all of these factors are hard to isolate and often
end up affecting both N and ∂. This is problematic and exposes the many
limitations in both this analysis and social science research in
general. It would indeed be helpful to more formally describe---through
regression analysis---the effect that any one of these factors has on a
certain individual's propensity to deviate. For now, this analysis will
attempt to introduce some correlation and leave the door open for future
research.

Using the model created above I will use basic tools of game theory to
analyze the effect that social structures have on an individual's
incentive to deviate. I will ultimately argue that hunter-gathering
societies were the most effective in minimizing this incentive to
deviate. This paper will test which characteristics of hunter-gathering,
agrarian, and industrial societies tend to increase N and decrease ∂,
and will find an increase in deviant behavior as societies become more
complex and industrialized. Finally the paper will analyze a particular
development scheme---solidarity lending in microfinance---in order to
test whether its successful development outcomes can be explained by
analogizing to an alignment of incentives from deviation to cooperation.

# Game Theory and Hunter-Gathering Societies

## Standard of Living in Hunter-Gathering Societies

The standard of living in hunter-gathering societies was low. The
average life span for most hunter-gatherers was approximately 33 years
at birth.[^23] Although the precision of these measures is subject to
debate,[^24] early hunter-gatherers had plenty of reasons to worry about
their health. A recent study of modern hunter-gathering tribes listed
common illness, preventable diseases, death as a result of climate,
homicide, and attacks by animals as contributing to early mortality
among hunter-gathering tribes.[^25] Although there is notable ambiguity,
there is some reason to believe that constant and sudden death was very
much a part of early hunter gathering societies. [^26]

The standard of living and mortality rates decreased N because the high
probability of death and high incidence of sudden death meant that an
individual could only expect to play a small amount of rounds before
they died. This would have reduced the incentives for cooperative
behavior (inasmuch as members of these tribes were often more concerned
with daily survival than with thinking about future interactions with
members of their own tribe).

However, it is important to note that these expected results conflict
somewhat with the practice of modern hunter-gatherers. For example, the
Ache tribe of eastern Paraguay exhibits similar patterns of disease and
life-expectancy to hunter-gathering tribes of antiquity, yet is not
characterized by uncooperative behavior.[^27] This analysis suggests
that even if life expectancy is a contributing factor to individual
deviation, other factors weigh more heavily.

The standard of living and mortality rates probably increased ∂ because
the high incidence of death decreased an individual's belief in the
benefits of the future. In the first instance, the constant search for
food and high likelihood of death meant that hunter-gatherers were
surrounded by evidence of their precarious future.[^28] When combined
with their relatively small expectation of N, it would seem as if the
hunter-gathering standard of living did not incentivize cooperative
behavior. The result is that we can expect the individual ∂ for
hunter-gatherers to be relatively large. Again, practice seems to
contradict this result, and a survey of psychological well-being in many
hunter-gathering tribes of Africa found that most had a generally
positive outlook on life.[^29] This attitude would tend to imply a
preference for, not against, cooperation.

## Social Welfare in Hunter-Gathering Societies

Hunter-gatherers were also known to participate in social distribution
programs, known as "food-sharing."[^30] An example of this food-sharing
program can be seen in the distribution process of the modern Ache tribe
of Paraguay.[^31] The food-sharing program involves hunter-gatherers
bringing a considerable excess of food after every hunt or forage in
order to feed the tribes.[^32] Food-sharing itself can be thought of as
a premium; it is a kind of hunter-gathering form of health
insurance.[^33] A typical hunter-gathering band will have different
individuals performing different functions as either net donors of food
or net recipients of food.[^34]

Social welfare in hunter-gathering societies probably increased N
because it increased individual dependence on the wider society.
Applying this system of food sharing to the model, it is expected that
the food-sharing system will increase each individual's N. Indeed this
is actually seen in the practice of modern hunter-gathering tribes, and
forms the basis for hunter-gathering social-security systems.[^35] The
increased cooperation in food-sharing structures can be explained
because such systems creates a positive feedback mechanism where each
round that an individual plays magnifies that individual's future
reliance on a community.[^36] Were an individual to choose not to
participate in the food-sharing programs, that individual would likely
find themselves ostracized from the group and unable to recoup the lost
gains in the future with more consumption in the present.[^37] Evidence
for this type of behavior is found in other animal groups. One
particularly interesting case was that of the vampire bat. Where the
bats participated in similar social welfare programs, the food donations
were thought to represent a social investment ensuring that others would
feed them in return.[^38] Given the long-term gains associated with
these social structures, we can conclude that food-sharing programs
probably increase each hunter-gatherer's expectation of N.

Social welfare structures of hunter-gathering societies decreased ∂ due
to increased awareness of an individual's expected punishment for
deviation. First, food-sharing is a tool that improves an individual's
future outlook since participation almost guarantees that the individual
will be compensated during old age and during unexpected setbacks such
as illness. Second, the structure of food-sharing programs has a
built-in punishment mechanism. Individuals who do not participate in the
food-sharing programs are often ostracized by the group and end up
without food during old age. The result is that both future prospects
and punishment decrease ∂ and make an individual less likely to deviate.
The vampire bat example above also supports the conclusion that
food-sharing is likely to make an individual more patient when partaking
in present activity. Much like the vampire bat's regurgitation of its
own food for the benefit of other members, hunter-gatherer activity can
be thought of as an initial investment for long-term returns. Future
research may be able be to determine whether the degree to which
individuals collect surplus food is affected by how long they anticipate
being dependent on the surplus of others later in life.

## Social Structures of Hunter-Gatherers.

Contemporary hunter-gatherers often show extensive cooperation among
members of a band.[^39] Postmarital residence among hunter-gatherers
tends to be matrilocal.[^40] The benefit of this arrangement is that
mothers can also enjoy childcare support from their own mothers, who
continue living nearby.[^41] Historically, hunter-gatherer bands were
characterized by their small size and were reflective of an equilibrium
state between humans and their resources. Bands were often grouped
together into larger "clans" of 50 to 100 adults, who were often
described as belonging to the same people.[^42]

The social structures of hunter-gathering societies probably increased N
because they made hunter-gatherers more dependent on other members in
the group. The very nature of hunter-gatherer post marital residential
arrangements required that each individual became part of collective
units. Furthermore, the typically small size of bands meant that each
individual was integral to the survival of the whole. Some sociological
experiments have demonstrated that the larger the group, the less the
individual feels responsible and invested in that group's mission.[^43]
For example, as hunter-gathering bands grew larger, they were often more
susceptible to intra-band disputes,[^44] and bands themselves were more
likely to fight amongst one another.[^45] The result was that
hunter-gatherers in tight-knit groups were intrinsically tied to their
respective societies to such a degree that their individual N was
increased.

The social structures of hunter-gatherers decreased ∂ because more
interrelated societies made punishment more credible. First, the
monitoring effects of the matrilineal organizations and the size of the
bands were very effective in punishing individual deviation. Second,
this interdependence also required that individuals pool their resources
together.[^46] The upshot is that hunter-gathering social structures are
structured in such a way that they are likely to make individuals more
patient.

## Political Structures of Hunter-Gatherers.

Hunter-gathering bands often had no effective government or formal
laws.[^47] Even where the bands exhibited some type of hierarchical
leadership, sometimes referred to as "headmen," these leaders typically
had little more authority than other people in the band.[^48] In fact,
hunter-gatherers have been renowned for their political egalitarianism,
with most decisions being reached through deliberation and
consensus.[^49] Punishment often came in the form of ridicule,
disobedience, rebelling, ostracizing, expulsion, or execution.[^50]
Though the severity of punishment varied, even relatively lenient
punishment, such as ridicule, was likely quite effective because of the
limited social circle.

Hunter-gathering political institutions increased N because they
increased a particular individual's involvement in communal decisions.
The small bands, weak headmen, and general sexual equality imply that
hunter-gathering societies were mainly egalitarian. Egalitarianism,
particularly in small groups, leads to greater individual involvement in
the collective/political decisions of the group.[^51] This greater
involvement in turn meant that hunter-gatherers took greater ownership
of group decisions, and as such relatively increased the amount of
rounds that they expected to play in a certain game. In fact, this
outcome would be consistent with many forms of egalitarian game
theoretic models.[^52]

Hunter-gathering political institutions had an ambiguous effect on ∂
since punishment often varied in degree and application. This outcome is
similar to the logic underlying the analysis of the length of game. A
survey of the literature that dealt with the effectiveness of punishment
in hunter-gatherers led to ambiguous results. Some studies found that
egalitarian social structures had positive effects on long-term
individual conformity while others found the inverse.[^53] In
particular, some modern tribes that exhibit egalitarian political
institutions still showed very little, if any cooperation at the
communal level. For example the Machiguengua tribe is characterized by
somewhat egalitarian social structures but demonstrated very little
cooperation at the communal level.[^54] This behavior contrasts with
that of members of the Ache tribe who exhibit much more cooperative
behavior at the communal level.[^55] Part of this ambiguity may result
from the fact that egalitarianism diffuses power structures among
several members of society. These diffusions of power mean that it is
harder to institute collective punishment because of collective action
problems.[^56]

Obviously various factors were at play that worked to increase or
decrease N and lambda in these societies. The overall structures of
hunter-gathering societies, however, tended to increase N and decrease
lambda, thereby improving cooperative outcomes. The small communities,
mostly effective punishment, and strong family ties worked to foster
cooperation. Furthermore, food-sharing programs were a visible and
dependable encouragement to participate in cooperative structures, and
were a support system that would not be available for deviants. Finally,
the generally egalitarian nature of these societies fostered political
inclusion and enhanced the "buy-in" of most members in making important
decisions. These incentives in favor of cooperation outweighed
uncooperative tendencies resulting from short lifespans and the risk of
sudden death.

# Game Theory and Agrarian Societies

## Standard of Living in Agrarian Societies.

Agrarian societies were marked by higher populations compared to their
hunter-gathering predecessors.[^57] This higher density combined with
the domestication of animals tended to actually worsen the average
quality of life and incidence of disease for most humans.[^58] In
particular, a comparison of contemporaneous hunter-gatherers to farmers
suggests that in the similar conditions, farmers suffered higher rates
of infection due to the increase in human settlements and poorer
nutrition.[^59] Generally, estimates for life expectancy during this
period vary, but some figures suggest an average range between 20 -- 35
years.[^60]

The population structure of agrarian societies tended to decrease N
because life spans were low and death was sudden. As we have seen above,
group size and lower life expectancy can play a factor in an
individual's determination of the probability of future games.[^61]
Individuals who believe that the game will be cut off abruptly and
without notice (as was the case for hunter-gathering and early agrarian
societies), will be less likely to expect repeated play in the
future.[^62] Further, the higher group size is likely to contribute to
individual expectation of decreased number of rounds.[^63] Since the
amount of people increased compared to hunter-gatherers, there was less
fear of being identified for punishment mechanisms. This generally
reflects the premise that the larger the population, the greater the
likelihood that a society will be subject to free-riding.

The standard of living probably increased ∂ because the high incidence
of disease and low quality of life meant that an individual's future
prospects were grim. As stated above, individuals who wish to save for
the future---that is, individuals with a relatively low level of ∂---are
more likely to do so where they believe that the future will be more
promising than the present. The future for most members of agrarian
societies was grim, and was possibly even worse than the future for
hunter-gathering societies.[^64] Cities were cramped and filled with
disease, and the most promising product of work for most members of the
worker classes was a release from bondage.[^65] In effect, there was
very little about the quality of life that would inspire an agrarian
worker to save for the future. As such, we can expect that the quality
of life increased ∂ for most members of agrarian societies.

## Social Welfare in Agrarian Societies.

Unlike hunter-gathering societies, Agrarian societies became much more
hierarchical.[^66] This structure created many more outlets to which an
individual could turn when looking for social welfare support.[^67] This
stratification also combined to create and accentuate non-agrarian
classes of merchants and guilds. These new classes heightened social
divisions and decreased class-based interdependence, as compared to
larger social-based welfare programs.[^68] It is unclear how the welfare
structure of agrarian societies would affect N. There was probably some
decrease in N that resulted from increases in hierarchies, but there may
have been some increase in N due to increases in welfare policies within
each class. Studies have shown that increased hierarchies can have
variable effects on group cohesion.[^69] The hierarchy effect will be
discussed more fully below.

In the context of agrarian societies, two factors contributed to a
particular individual's dependence on her society. First, as compared to
hunter-gathering societies, agrarian welfare systems were able to rely
less on the whole group. Second, agrarian societies also lacked
incentive programs such as food-sharing, and therefore did not possess
experiential confirmation of the future benefits of providing more. At
the same time, many members of agrarian populations now benefited from
the propagation of guilds, which often replaced traditional welfare
structures, making each individual more tied to their particular guild.
Given the diffuse nature of dependence-creating or dependence-reducing
structures, it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion regarding what the
expected N would be for an individual player.

The welfare structure of agrarian societies probably also had an
ambiguous effect on ∂. While some individuals had better prospects for
the future, others were worse off than in hunter-gathering societies.
These outcomes ultimately depended on factors other than social welfare
systems, and were likely due to the probability of punishment. Highly
stratified societies have varied in terms of their efficiency in
punishing group members.[^70] The ability of the hierarchical structures
to punish has also been found to correlate to their respective
sizes.[^71] The result is that it may be possible that the welfare
hierarchy, or lack thereof, in agrarian societies could send mixed
signals to players. For example, if a player was at the top of a
hierarchy, there was little risk of punishment from other players. Or,
if the hierarchy was large and spread out, even members at the bottom
would probably not have strong incentives due to a lessened fear of
individual punishment.[^72]

## Social Structure of Agrarian Societies

In agrarian societies, kinship became less important as a means of
regulating social behavior.[^73] Guilds and other social institutions
displaced family structures where interests were aligned in accordance
with economic incentives.[^74] Further, the role of women diminished in
agrarian societies.[^75] These societies also became much more extreme
in their degree of social stratification.[^76] Agrarian societies tended
to create newfound divisions among urban and rural populations.
Furthermore, child-rearing in agrarian societies also tended to be much
more authoritarian when compared to hunter-gathering societies.[^77]

The social structure of agrarian societies had a mixed effect on N
because the hierarchical structures and the diminished role of women
likely contributed to decreased intra-population interdependence, but
newfound specialization may have also led to an increase in trade
interdependence. First, the erosion of the hunter-gathering kinship
structure meant that the strong incentives created by matrilineal bonds
were often weakened, having a proportional decrease in N. Second, the
rise of guilds is likely to have increased N because they made each
individual member of the guild accountable to the other members of the
guild. Third, the divisions between urban and rural class could have
decreased N for individuals in aggregate, decreasing urban dwellers
interconnectedness with rural dwellers, and vice versa.

The social structure of Agrarian societies increased ∂ overall because
stratification decreased the credibility of punishment regimes as well
as decreasing the average individual's expected prospects for the
future*.* For those individuals who were at the top of the hierarchical
structures, as well as other empowered actors such as patriarchs,
punishment also became less credible as societies developed patronage
and bribing systems. However, while these new stratified social
structures would have decreased the expected threat of punishment for
men, they could have increased the probability of punishment for women,
making ∂ variable by gender and therefore having an ambiguous effect on
group behavior.

## Political Structures of Agrarian Societies.

The main institutional innovation of agrarian societies was the creation
of the state.[^78] The rise of the state brought some measurable gains,
as there now existed an institution to manage resource distribution. In
particular, the state facilitated a distribution spread from specialist
producers of metal tools, cartwheels, cloth and similar goods to
productive farmers.[^79] The state also had a hand in the rise of
writing and mathematics.[^80] Agrarian governments also gave rise to
systems of patronage and extractive governments, the precursors to
modern organizations.[^81] Power was often extremely concentrated among
religious elite and states began to control internal violence by
enforcing rules of law.[^82] Despite this centralization, most
agricultural societies tended to be unstable. Agricultural communities
were often rife with dynastic changes, foreign occupation, and collapses
of large states into small city-states.[^83]

The political structures of agrarian societies decreased individual N
because most individuals' political involvement decreased substantially.
Not only were agrarian societies rife with instability and violence, but
also most individuals had no real contact with their rulers. They were
de facto subjects or slaves in monarchical systems. With so much
insecurity and such low ability to exert influence, it is unlikely that
an individual would expect any game to last, therefore decreasing N.
Generally, since the more ownership a particular individual has in a
certain matter (in this particular case, governance) the more likely
that the individual will internalize the costs and benefits of that
particular matter.[^84] The increased disconnectedness of agrarian
citizens from their polity meant that their respective N would decrease.

The political structure of agrarian societies also decreased ∂ since
punishment could now be monopolized by the state. This was more
effective than punishment during hunter-gathering societies, although
there may have been some increasing ability to for individuals to shirk
punishment due to the sheer increase in the number of people that would
need to be punished.[^85] The result was that, while individuals living
in agrarian societies were readily able to identify deviant behavior and
witness the effects of deviance first hand, there were still incentives
to cheat the system. That is, now that there was a monopolized force
dictating whether conduct was deviant or not, and the direct matrilineal
support systems had been replaced, there was opportunity to be gained by
attempting to deviate while not being caught.

In agrarian societies, the localized group and family bonds that were so
important in hunter-gatherer groups were displaced by structures such as
guilds. They were also overshadowed by the rise of the state. While
guilds and state actors did increase N and decrease lambda, the overall
effect of agrarian organizational structures was to reduce cooperation.
While guilds could and did increase cooperation for economic reasons,
they were only one subsection of a highly stratified society.

High-class individuals were unlikely to be held accountable by their
peers, while deviant lower-class individuals were less likely to be
identified than under a hunter-gathering system. While these incentives
to deviate grew, there was no commensurate increase in stability or life
expectancy that could increase N. With less personal stake in the
governance system, and more opportunities to cheat without being readily
observed, cooperation suffered.

# Game Theory and Industrial Societies

## Standard of Living in Industrial Societies.

The industrial revolution brought about many increases in wealth,
technology, and productivity but did little to improve the actual living
conditions of many of its denizens.[^86] As on scholar wrote, "for many
skilled workers, the quality of life decreased a great deal in the first
60 years of the Industrial Revolution. Skilled weavers, for example,
lived well in pre-industrial society as a kind of middle class. Workers
spent all the light of day at work and came home with little energy,
space, or light to play sports or games. The new industrial pace and
factory system were at odds with the old traditional festivals, which
dotted the village holiday calendar. Plus, local governments actively
sought to ban traditional festivals in the cities. In the new
working-class neighborhoods, people did not share the same traditional
sense of a village community. Owners fined workers who left their jobs
to return to their villages for festivals because they interrupted the
efficient flow of work at the factories."[^87] It was not surprising
that disease also spread during this period at an alarming rate.[^88]

The standard of living in industrial societies had a mixed effect on N.
Real gains in actual standards of living were sporadic and inconsistent
across population, but did feature some improvements that could have
increased N.[^89] While some individuals saw their prospects improve,
others lived in conditions no better than most hunter-gatherers.[^90]
With that uneven development in mind, the newfound commercial
opportunities in industrial societies could have also increased N to
some degree. The rise of industry and modern savings regimes also meant
that individuals who saved could possibly experience direct benefits in
the future from their work in the present.[^91]

The standard of living in industrial societies also had a mixed effect
on ∂ since some individuals saw their future prospects improve, while
others saw it worsen. Whereas some individuals were able to plan for the
future, especially those in the merchant classes, the lower classes were
unlikely to perceive a much higher likelihood of improvement in future
prospects. However, the increased use of welfare during industrial
societies (particularly in England) could have created the perception
for all classes that their future prospects were improving.[^92]

## Social Welfare in Industrial Societies.

As industrial societies became larger, individuals relied less on social
structures to provide a safety net and instead relied more on the
government and polity as a tool for redistribution and social welfare.
One particular example is the English Old Poor Laws,[^93] a parish-based
system, where people who were unable to work would receive financial
support via Overseers of the Poor.[^94] These systems centralized aid
and removed it from a system of joint communal work to provide for the
local destitute, to a more formal and often despotic system of aid.
Although there was already social precedent for these systems of
welfare, the degree by which poor laws removed the community as primary
caretaker of the poor, and substituted the state, was unprecedented.

Social welfare in industrial societies had a mixed effect on N because
these policies could often increase length of life, yet they suffered
from unevenness in application. For one, individuals that were actually
receiving welfare benefits would have increased ties and dependency to
their benefactor, and probably to their society as a whole. Yet this
structure in and of itself could have decreased social
interconnectedness by creating competition for welfare funds. Given the
prevalence of differential welfare policies, especially early into the
industrial revolution, the effect on each individual's N is hard to
predict.

Social welfare structures in industrial societies had a mixed effect on
∂ because they increased some individuals' prospects for the future.
However, their differential application made some individuals believe
that their prospects would improve in the future while some---those who
didn't receive welfare---believed that their future prospects wouldn't
change. This effect is hard to gauge at a macro level, since many other
factors contributed to individual perceptions of future prospects,
including the actual technical advances brought by the industrial
revolution.[^95]

## Social Structure of Industrial Societies.

The social fabric of industrial societies underwent many changes when
compared to agrarian and industrial societies. In particular, industrial
societies were notable for the size of the middle class and the shifting
of power from landed nobility to industrialists.[^96] The increased
production that resulted from the industrial revolution also had an
effect on the amount of time people were able to spend partaking in
leisure.[^97] Further, social mobility was much greater in industrial
societies than agrarian or even hunter-gathering.[^98]

The social structure of industrial societies increased N due to the rise
of the middle class. Greater middle classes meant that each class relied
on the success of the rest of society. Class stratification in
industrial societies seemed to actually decrease somewhat as compared
with agrarian societies, with most members of these particular societies
being part of the middle class.[^99] Furthermore, industrial societies
were also much tended to be highly urban, diminishing the class
stratification pressures exerted by starker divisions found in agrarian
societies between the landed elite and peasant this duality of
socioeconomic organization.[^100]

The social structure of industrial societies decreased ∂ since
individuals believed that their prospects for the future were improving.
Punishment mechanisms increased in many countries. There was increased
productivity in industrial societies, and increases in wealth for most
members of industrial societies. The result was that the average
individual believed that the prospects for the future were improving and
would therefore choose to forgo consumption in the present for
consumption in the future.[^101]

## Political Organization of Industrial Societies.

When compared to agrarian societies, whose governing elite was generally
small, homogeneous, and well-defined, the political elite in industrial
nations had broad ranging ways to influence their societies.[^102] The
rapid changes brought on by the industrial revolution, coupled with
shifts in the sources of power (economic vs. land-based) also meant that
governments often changed from autocratic to more democratic
systems.[^103] This shift in governmental structure meant that access to
government and influence shifted from an easily identifiable class of
individuals to a greater quantity of amorphous entities.[^104]

The political structure of industrial societies increased N since
political involvement increased for some individuals (namely men).[^105]
Industrial societies often witnessed the enfranchisement of large swaths
of the population.[^106] Furthermore, autocratic dictatorships started
to break down and democracy as a form of government became more
prevalent.[^107] Democracy increased the average person's belief in and
access to his government---his is key, since women were usually not
allowed political participation---and therefore most men could envision
direct influence on government.[^108] The result is that for most men,
the industrial revolution brought on increased N, due to their increased
access to political spheres. At the broad societal level, however, it is
fair say that the effect on N was still probably mixed, since women were
usually not afforded political participation.

The political structure of industrial societies had a mixed effect on ∂.
First, these societies had an amorphous elite structure[^109] and
individuals could avoid punishment by aligning themselves with the right
kind of elite. Second, the rapidly changing economic landscape made it
easier to avoid punishment, given the fluidity of class structures and
the relative ease with which individuals could traverse through
them.[^110] The result of these amorphous class structures on ∂ is that
it likely decreased the probability that a particular individual would
internalize punishment regimes, and as such, made it more likely that
they would deviate.

Overall, though there were possible improvements in living conditions
for industrial residents, these enhancements were, in practical terms,
only available for certain classes. The poor continued to live in
squalid conditions and suffer from malnutrition, and they also had to
contend with the deleterious health effects of pollutants as a byproduct
of industrialization. Ironically, the relaxation of strict hierarchies
and increased possibilities of class mobility may actually have
incentivized deviation. Individuals would, understandably, be more
interested in moving up to a more stable class than in playing repeated
rounds with the same players. Though the state was far more stable in
industrialized societies than in agrarian, and played a larger role in
encouraging social welfare, it is unclear that these welfare programs
appropriately incentivized cooperation. Instead, they may have increased
competition as the lower classes fought over scarce resources.

The analysis of hunter-gatherer, agrarian, and industrial societies
supports the theory that more complex societies have more difficulty
appropriately aligning incentives. Hunter-gatherer societies depended on
complete group cooperation for survival, whereas later organizational
approaches could handle higher amounts of deviation. However, for large
portions of agrarian and industrial societies, the effect of this
misalignment was to leave many residents in the same state of
malnutrition and underutilization as in primitive societies. This
remained true despite an overall increase in societal resources that
should have resulted in higher standards of living.

# Case Study: Solidarity Lending in Microfinance

As the analysis above shows, even if individual behavior patterns are
influenced by biology, our decision sets also rely on the types of
stimuli that we receive throughout our lives.[^111] These stimuli come
from various sources: family, social interaction, economic forces, legal
regimes, enforcement of these regimes, and rule of law, among many
others.

In the context of this paper's model, the lesson is clear: social
structures inform our incentives. However, the incentives from social
structures are counterbalanced by the individual's tendency to deviate
towards outcomes that may not benefit the collective whole based on
short-term gains. The more modern societies became, the weaker the
effect of social structures on each individual's utility function, and
the higher the tendency to deviate. The implication is that incentive
structures are an important tool in the realm of development. This paper
will analyze the solidarity-lending model of microfinance and show that
it supports the assertion that in structuring development programs,
minimizing individual incentive to deviate can lead to positive
outcomes.

Solidarity lending is useful to test the model presented in this paper
because the places where it is mostly used are characterized by social
structures and incentive regimes that resemble those humans faced as
hunter-gatherers and agrarian farmers. Further, the fact that
cooperation lessens or leads to ambiguous results as the societies grow
provides an important lesson. The greater the complexity of a given
society, the harder it is to achieve social cooperation, and the more
important other types of incentives become. This lesson can provide
support for the institutionalist development movement, because, in
emphasizing strong institutions, the institutionalists are really just
emphasizing the creation of social structures that diminish incentives
to deviate. The main difference is that institutionalists construct
their theories in a way that can account for the complexity of modern
societies.

## What is the structure of solidarity lending in microfinance?

Solidarity lending is a practice within the realm of microfinance[^112]
where small groups borrow as a group and encourage one another to
repay.[^113] These groups (sometimes referred to as "solidarity groups")
generally function by having potential borrowers from the same
geographic area form groups of five. In creating these groups each group
member is required to vouch for the creditworthiness of the others, save
a certain amount per week, and purchase a share in the bank.[^114] The
groups also elect a chairperson, who becomes the last member of the
group to receive the loan.[^115] Loans are made to two members at a time
and must be repaid in equal installments over 50 weeks.[^116] Once the
first two members have met their payment obligations the lending scheme
is triggered again, making the next two members eligible for
loans.[^117] The group chairperson, elected by the five members of the
group, is the last to become eligible for a loan.

## How does Solidarity Lending Comport with the Model?

The structure of solidarity lending in microfinance increases N because
it increases an individual's standard of living, dependence on community
for welfare, social interdependence, and political involvement within
their society. The structure of solidarity lending clearly parallels the
structure of hunter-gathering societies. First, participants are broken
up into small groups. As discussed above, the smaller the group, the
more likely the individual is to perceive a longer time horizon within
the group. Second, solidarity lending also features vouching systems
where each member has to pledge for the other. Further, the disbursement
mechanisms guaranteed that everyone was invested in the long-term
results of the lending scheme, in expectation of future punishment for
failure to repay.[^118]

The structure of solidarity lending in microfinance also decreases ∂
since it increases each participant's belief in future prospects, as
well as creating credible punishment mechanisms. First, the vouching
structure was an important way to anticipate future punishment. That is,
as members were required to vouch for the creditworthiness of the
others, every individual had an incentive to punish the others for lack
of timely payments or effort in conducting the business. Second, the
election of a chairperson created a quasi-hierarchical structure that
combined the benefits of egalitarian punishment[^119] with the top-down
and structuring benefits of hierarchies.[^120] The effect was that while
all individuals were invested, there was one person within the group
that was particularly invested in having everyone else comport to the
terms of the loan. The end result was that individuals had plenty of
hard punishment mechanisms that were likely to decrease ∂ and in effect
decrease the individual incentive to deviate.

## Do we see beneficial development effects in practice?

The general structure of solidarity lending lowers the credit monitoring
costs involved in assessing, managing and collecting loans.[^121]
Solidarity lending has also decreased the default risk for each
individual and the group as a whole.[^122] For example, while an
individual borrower's average outstanding loan balance was \$1,024, the
average loan balance outstanding to solidarity lenders was \$109.[^123]

The linkage benefits of microlending extend even past the initial
recipients of the loans. In one World Bank study "social capital and
economic empowerment increased equally for participants and
non-participants in program areas".[^124] Another World Bank study cited
the importance of the rules (i.e., incentives) flowing from the lenders
in these programs to the borrowers.[^125] Their results found a positive
correlation between repayment and group involvement.[^126] Microfinance
has also been found to cure information asymmetries in the market for
loans in rural areas.[^127]

Microfinance also paves the way for a return of gender parity among
societies. Many women in these societies would not be able to borrow
under a standard lending model and thus would have difficulty in
contributing outside the home. Contributing financial resources to the
family or community confers greater legitimacy and value to women's
views and gives them more entitlements than they would otherwise have.
Studies of microfinance clients from various institutions around the
world show that the women themselves very often perceive that they
receive more respect from their families and their
communities---particularly from male members---than they did before
joining a microfinance program. Where women have the freedom to move
about publicly, their success in business is often highly visible in the
community.[^128]

Furthermore, since solidarity lending and microfinance schemes generally
take place in developing countries, these systems have been found to
increase individual communal perception of governance.[^129]
Interestingly, the ability of microfinance to create beneficial outcomes
and incentivize governance decrease as lending shifted from rural
villages to large cities.

The analysis above shows that small groups, tight social pressure, large
communal linkages, and group interdependence characterize solidarity
lending. These same elements were strikingly present in the analysis of
hunter-gathering societies. This paper also found that cooperative
behavior maximizes group surplus.

# Conclusion

This paper set out with the goal of creating a model that used game
theory to identify what types of social structures tend to minimize
individual incentives to deviate. In doing so, this paper argued that
structures fostering cooperative behavior among individuals are an
important feature when devising development policy.

In creating the model above, this paper hoped to provide some insight on
why certain social structures may or may not be effective in fostering
development. Throughout the entire analysis, one feature remained
constant: social growth and complexity decreases the ability of social
groups to exert the pressure needed to achieve what can be viewed as an
aggregate cooperative equilibrium. In crafting future development policy
this conclusion is important because it supports the institutionalist
take that institutions matter, and hints at a reason for why this is the
case.

In sum, social structures that tend to have the capacity to punish
individuals effectively, and that minimize that particular individual's
incentive to deviate from the cooperative equilibrium, tend to be
structured in a form most like hunter-gathering societies. As societies
became more complex, the ability to appropriately align incentives
becomes weaker and then necessitates substitution in the form of laws
and social institutions. These substitutes have come in the form of
laws, civil society groups, imperialism, colonialism, and theology. Yet
the societies whose norms are best able to create internalized
punishment regimes are the ones that generally are best able to prosper.
In terms of development, this paper concludes by asking, can reverting
to our past social structures help shape and grow our future?

    play a role in players' strategies. Generally, solving these
    problems by backward induction (which is the process of reasoning
    backwards in time, from the end of a problem or situation, to
    determine a sequence of optimal actions) would still lead to
    deviation from cooperative behavior, yet research shows that
    cooperative behavior can still be achieved depending on each
    player's ∂ and N. Furthermore, the case of infinite time horizons is
    notable in the context of the prisoner's dilemma, because rational

    game to human interactions. *Cf*. Boyd at 173 with [Rapoport
    228.]{.smallcaps}

[^11]: Support for this assumption follows from numerous studies that
    show that humans tend to be biased towards cooperative behavior
    despite their individual incentives. *See e.g.,* Boyd at 173; [Glenn

[^14]: The higher the standard of living, the higher N becomes, all else
    equal. This follows simply from the fact that standard of living
    correlates somewhat positively to an individual's expected
    life-span, and the longer someone lives the more rounds that person
    actually plays. Since this model is looking at individual incentives
    at time zero, when describing "N" this paper is really describing a
    particular individual's expected N, not their actual N. The result
    is that, the higher the standard of living, the higher an individual
    would expect N to be, and therefore the higher the number of
    expected rounds. As we have seen above, *supra* note ###, the higher
    N, the higher the probability of cooperative behavior. *See also*

[^15]: The more an individual depends on her particular community for
    welfare (that is, the ability to obtain benefits from other members
    of her society) the higher N. This correlation stems from previous
    research regarding the beneficial economic effects of social safety
    nets, and particularly, the primacy of incentive structures in the
    creation of efficient safety net mechanisms. *See e.g.,* Chris de
    Neubourg, Incentives and the Role of Institutions in the Provision
    of Social Safety Nets, World Bank Institute Working Paper No. 0226,
    Pages 2, 17 (2002).

[^16]: The more an individual depends on her particular society for
    sustenance, the higher N. The reasoning here is that---as previous
    research has indicated---interdependence among individuals in a
    particular group invariably leads to cooperation. *See e.g.,* David
    W. Johnson and Roger T. Johnson, *Positive Interdependence: Key to
    Effective Cooperation* in Interaction in [Rachel

[^17]: The greater an individual's ability to affect the political
    underpinnings of her society, the greater her N. This assertion
    follows from the fact that political participation not only
    increases an individual's interdependence with her community, but
    also from the fact that political interdependence foster social
    capital, which has also been shown to increase individual
    participation in a given society, and as a result foster even
    greater interdependence. *See e.g.,* Ronald La Due Lake and Robert

[^18]: The more credible the punishment regime, given the factors that
    influenced N, the lower ∂. An individual will be less likely to
    discount the future in favor of present gains by deviation when the
    present decision will result in punishment for future rounds.

    certain investment vehicles, namely, private equity funds. Similar
    to matrilineal social structures, most private equity funds
    structures are characterized by mutual pooling of savings and

[^86]: As a proxy for the decrease in the general well-being of
    industrial citizens, we can look to measurements of height among men
    in industrial England*.* Many English cities suffered decreases in
    their average life expectancy of more than 25%, to around 45 years
    at birth. Chronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm and people
    often lived in squalor. City dwellings were described as crude
    shanties and shacks. Some were not completely enclosed, some with
    dirt floors. These slum areas had extremely high population
    densities. It was common for groups of unrelated mill workers to
    share rooms in very low quality housing where eight to ten people
    would occupy a single room, which often had no furniture. The
    occupants would sleep on a pile of straw or sawdust. *Did Living

[^98]: Compared with agrarian societies, industrial societies offered
    many more opportunities for individuals to improve their status.  In
    agrarian societies, high birthrates ensured an oversupply of labor
    in almost every generation.  At every level in society, a
    substantial percentage of children were obliged to work in
    occupations of lower status than their parents or to join the ranks
    of beggars, outlaws, prostitutes, and vagabonds.  Although a few
    improved their situation, far more were downwardly mobile. In
    industrial societies, conditions are strikingly different.  Falling
    birthrates have reduced the oversupply of labor, while technological
    advances have greatly increased the proportion of high-status,
    high-income jobs.
