**PRELIMINARY STATEMENT**  
	For the last 10 years, there have been a string of consistent decisions that reflect the great progress of our time. These decisions have synthesized advances in science, technology, and juridical thinking. The advent of the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) has served as the point of tangency between the advances in science and jurisprudence. Yet, like most technology it has been met with great fervor and skepticism, notwithstanding that the fact that DNA Identification is the most protective of information collection methods. The defendant, by attempting to block a small swabbing, would like to stunt not only progress in science and social change, but also the growth in fourth amendment protections afforded to their client. With allowing the swabbing to go forward, one would not only be in accordance with the shape and momentum of society, a society that is more protective of individual rights, yet can do so much more with less intrusive but more effective information, but would continue the steady stream of decisions that have balanced private interest with the broader goal of creating a more just and safe nation.   
**STATEMENT OF FACTS**  
		In the early morning of January 19, 2012, a joint, FBI-NYPD, operation were executing an arrest warrant for a suspected murderer. After they tried repeatedly to knock and ask for the door to be opened, they realized that the suspect could place them in a precarious situation, and as such proceeded to open the door. As they opened the door, they were met by Ms. Park who, after repeated attempts by the officers to allay the situation by exhibiting arrest warrants and badges, proceeded not only to create a threatening environment for the officers, but impeded their advances in pursuance of a suspected murderer. Although the joint taskforce was able to reach Mr. Park, they did not do so in time to secure any other evidence that could have helped solve the murders that he was accused of committing. 

**ARGUMENT**

1. 18 U.S.C. § 111A IS A CRIME OF VIOLENCE UNDER 18 U.S.C. § 16(B). THEREFORE IT IS A QUALIFYING OFFENSE FOR THE PURPOSES OF 42 U.S.C. § 14135a(a)(1)(A).   
1. **How to determine whether 18 U.S.C. § 111a is a qualifying offense under 18 U.S.C. § 16(b).**  
1. Categorical Approach for determining how 18 U.S.C. § 111a is a qualifying offense under 18 U.S.C. § 16(b).  
   In order for DNA collection and integration to be valid under the authority granted by 42 U.S.C. § 14135a the crime committed must be a qualifying offense. 42 U.S.C. § 14135a(d). One of the qualifying offenses is any crime of violence under section 16 of Title 18\. 42 U.S.C. § 14135a(d)(3) (18 U.S.C. § 16 defining crime of violence as an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against \[a\] person.”)  
   The Second Circuit has employed the categorical approach in determining whether an offense is a crime of violence. US v. Acosta (citing Leocal v. Ashcroft and Vargas-Sarmiento v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 448 F.3d 159, 166 (2d Cir. 2006); Jobson v. Ashcroft, 326 F. 3d 367, 371 (2d. Cir. 2003); Dalton v. Ashcroft, 257 F.3d 200, 204 (2d Cir. 2001); Ming Lam Sui v. INS, 250 F. 3d 105, 117-18 (2d Cir. 2001). Underlying this analysis is a determination that the crime, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that force will be used. Leocal, 125 S. Ct. at 381 (alluding to the requirements of 18 USC § 16; see also Dalton v. Ashcroft, 257 F. 3d 200, 204 (2d Cir. 2011). As a metric for the analysis is a requirement that it focus on “the intrinsic nature of the offense rather than on the factual circumstances. Leocal, 125 S. Ct. 383\.   
2. Natural reading as evidence that 18 U.S.C. § 111a is a crime of violence.   
   Even given that 18 U.S.C. § 111 is divisible, the statue when taken as a whole and given its natural meaning dictates that it is a crime of violence. 18 U.S.C. § 111a is a crime of violence when given effect to its ordinary or natural meaning. The first step in a court’s determination of whether a statute is a crime of violence is to give effect to the ordinary meaning of the elements of the statute. Leocal, 125 S. Ct. at 383\. § 111(a) delineates that whoever “forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes” shall be at given an 8-year sentence. 18 U.S.C. § 111\. When the statute is taken as a whole, the term forcibly must apply to each of its elements. U.S. v. Hertular 562 F. 3d 433 citing see, e.g., United States v. Bamberger, 452 F.2d 696, 699-700 (2d Cir. 1972). The second circuit elucidated that the word forcibly in section 111 necessarily limited the proscribed acts … \[than the\] unmodified verbs alone. United States v. Bamberger, 452 F.2d 696, 699\. This construction was then applied to the term threaten to conclude that when modified by forcible, “threaten” needed to include proof that the alleged threat would objectively inspire fear of pain, bodily harm, or death that is likely to be inflicted immediately the 1994 amendment notwithstanding. United States v. Chestaro, 197 F. 3d 600 (2d Cir. 1999); United States v. Delis, 558 F.3d 177 (2d Cir. 2009\) (discussing common-law meaning of assault). Even in the case where the elements of the offense have been interpreted in the context of their common law definition the court came to the same conclusion. Chestaro, 197 F.3d at 605\. (defining assault as modified by forcibly to imply either committed by either a willful attempt to inflict injury upon the person of another or by a threat to inflict injury upon the person of another which causes a reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm).    
   The dictionary definition of forcible also speaks to the substantial nature of its risk with 18 U.S.C. § 111\. “Forcible can be anything effected by force or threat of force against opposition or resistance.” Black’s Law Dictionary 9th Edition; Encyclopedia Britannica, Merian-Webster’s. Forcible entry is the act or instance of violently … taking possession of lands. Black’s Law Dictionary 9th Edition. The Second Circuit’s reading also suggests that 111 must be read as prohibiting acts or threats of bodily harm. Walker, 835 at 987\. Thus, when the statute is taken as a whole, and forcibly is given the prescribed definition by the courts, it is evident that 18 U.S.C. 111a involves a substantial risk that force will be used.   
3. Modified Categorical Approach as evidence that a simple assault as construed in light of the state and fact-scenario point to 18 U.S.C. 111a as being a crime of violence.   
   Under the modified categorical approach 111(a) is a crime of violence. Due to a difficulty in defining some of the terms in 111(a), the Second Circuit has found that § 111 is divisible and that the courts should analyze the statute under the modified categorical approach. \[citation\]. In a modified categorical approach the inquiry is first one where the court asks whether the statute of the conviction criminalizes conduct that falls exclusively within the federal definition of a predicate offense.  If so, there is no problem with respect to statutory interpretation. *Taylor v. United States*, 495 U.S. 575 at 599\. If the statute criminalizes both predicate and non predicate conduct then the second part of the modified categorical approach requires that we ask whether the government has shown that the common law definition of the element being challenged falls within the definition in the statute. *Shepard v. United States*, 544 U.S. 13, 24 (2005). The Supreme Court has only resorted to the modified categorical approach when the statuary definition of a predicate offense is broader than the common definition. *Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 at 599* (considering a narrow exception to the categorical approach in the context of the armed career criminal act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)). *See e.g.* *Chestaro* (Some of the terms in the statute were not defined and this ambiguity force the court in Chestaro to divide 111 into three components.) (the court specifically noting that the term “simple assault,” as used in both U.S.C. §§ 111 and 113 embrace\[s\] the common law meaning of assault). The Second Circuit then stated that simple assault required:

   “either a willful attempt to inflict injury upon the person of another, or ... a threat to inflict injury upon the person of another which, when coupled with an apparent present ability, causes a reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm.” (quoting United States v. Johnson, 637 F.2d 1224, 1242 n. 26 (9th Cir. 1980), *abrogated on other grounds by Shcmick v. United* States, 489 U.S. 705 (1989).)

   Contrary to what the defense will claim, the splitting of the statute does not entail complete coverage of a crime of violence. *Chestaro*, 197 F.3d at 606, (creating three distinct categories of conduct proscribed by the § 111 in the context of assault: (1) simple assault, which … does not involved touching; (2) assault that does involve contact but does not result in bodily harm injury or involve a weapon; and (3) assaults resulting in bodily injury or involving a weapon). The court in *Chestaro* required that for a simple assault, even with the limited facts, one would have to prove general intent to cause the harm described. *Id.* at 606\. (*stating* that  “when Congress wanted to require proof of injury or intent to injure, it knew how to do so, as is evidenced by its express inclusion of such requirements in [§ 113(a)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&pubNum=1000546&cite=18USCAS113&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=\(sc.RelatedInfo\)#co_pp_8b3b0000958a4) (3),” the provision regarding assault with a deadly weapon, with intent to do bodily harm. *United States v. Gan,* 636 F.2d 28, 30 (2d Cir. 1980).). Yet even this definition would start at a base offense level of ten and eclipse other statutes also defining a crime of violence. 18 U.S.C. § 111; U.S..G. §§ 2A2.2 and 2A2.4.   
   In this specific case Park’s conduct as submitted in the police report points to the violent nature of the conduct described. Police Report Par. 9\. In addition, we can infer from her conduct that her actions, taken in the context of an attempted arrest in a house, at night that included two gang members (with one being an accused murderer) in the middle of a gang war would objectively inspire fear and fulfill the forcible requirement is sufficient to fulfill the general intent requirement. See [*United States v. Walker,* 835 F.2d at 987](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1987159918&pubNum=350&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=\(sc.Keycite\)#co_pp_sp_350_987). (stating that the “use of the term threaten, as modified by forcible, needed to include “proof that the alleged threat would objectively inspire fear of pain, bodily harm, or death that is likely to be inflicted immediately”. )   
   These acts, in conjunction with the common law definition of a simple assault, the restrictive modification that forcible has on the elements, and the fact that congress intended the statute to be construed broadly imply that 18 U.S.C. is indeed clearly a crime of violence.  
   Furthermore, the demarcation of the crime as a misdemeanor does not have any bearing on whether the crime is of violence. The distinction between misdemeanors and felonies now commonly adopted is that offenses punishable by death, or by imprisonment in state prison are felonies whereas all other, are misdemeanors.

If there is ambiguity with respect to the interpretation of a statute, courts will defer to the agency’s reasonable interpretation of the statute. *Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council*, 467 U.S. 837 (1984).

2. 28 C.F.R. 28.2 provides the proper guidance for deciding that 18 U.S.C. § 111a is a qualifying offense for the purpose of 42 U.S.C. § 14135a(a)(1)(A).

§ 28.2 states unambiguously that 18 U.S.C. § 111 is a qualifying offense for the purpose of the DNA collection act. 28 C.F.R. 28.2 (stating that “the following offenses shall be treated for the purposes of the DNA collection act as qualifying Federal offenses … (3)(i) in title 18, section 111.”). 28.12 unambiguously states that “ The Bureau of Prisons shall collect a DNA sample from … individuals detain\[ed\] or who are arrested, facing charges, or convicted of a Federal Offense. 28 C.F.R. § 28.12 (a)-(b). The only exemption being made for detained non-United States persons. 28 C.F.R. § 28.12 (c). Recent regulations also point to the expansion of the definitions of qualifying offenses for the purpose of DNA collection. 2008 Section 1004 of the DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005 (“DNA Fingerprint Act”), Public Law 109-162 (broadening th categories of person subject to DNA-sample collection). Furthermore, Congressional intent also pointed to the desire that 111 be interpreted broadly in order to prevent violent acts *United States v. Feola,* 420 U.S. 671, 679, 95 S.Ct. 1255, 43 L.Ed.2d 541 (1975); *United States v. Walker,* 835 F.2d 983, 987 (2d Cir.1987). 

3. The most current U.S. Attorney General Memo does not limit this interpretation.

The most current attorney general memo does not limit this interpretation of the statute. The new memo stated that the authority to collect the DNA shall be exercised in conjunction with the statutory limitation to federal qualifying offenses. U.S. Department of Justice Memorandum January 1, 2011\. Yet, given that the Justice department regulation clearly states otherwise, the interpretive memo cannot the aforementioned congressional intent. Given the regulatory definitions and frameworks there is no doubt that 18 U.S.C. § 111 is a qualifying offense for the purposes of DNA collection. 

2.   THE COLLECTION OF DNA FROM PRE CONVICTION ARRESTEES DOES NOT VIOLATE THE FOURTH AMENDMENT PROHIBITION ON UNREASONABLE SEARCHES AND SEIZURES ……………………………..  
1. **The proper test to be applied in evaluating the validity of the governmental need is “The Special Needs Test.”**  
   1. Definition of the special test on its face shows that there is a sufficient need. 

   When there is no warrant or individualized suspicion for collection of DNA the initial question is how the collection scheme is analyzed. Given that the Supreme Court has never reviewed the constitutionality of a warrantless DNA databank collection procedure, the appropriate test being the special needs test is a “closed question”. Roe v. Marcotte, 193 F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 1999\) (discussing that the statute may still be constitutional if defendants can show some other significant government interest in the form of special needs beyond normal law enforcement) Id. at 81 citing Jones (precluding the application of Jones and approving the dissent therein with respect to violent offenders). 

   The special needs test balances the weight of an individuals’ interest in privacy against the special needs that supported the program. Ferguson, 532U.S. at 78\. (stating that the “‘special need’ that was advanced as a justification for the absence of a warrant or individualized suspicion was one divorced from the State's general interest in law enforcement.”) The initial, “need” side of the special needs inquiry thus requires an assessment of the primary purpose of the search scheme at issue. *Edmond,* 531 U.S. at 44\. The supreme Court will “decline to approve a program whose primary purpose is ultimately indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control.” *Id.*

   2. Case law points the low threshold required by the courts in order for the governmental to be valid. 

   *Amerson* teaches that the starting point for the balancing test is to assess the degree of the affected person's reasonable expectations of privacy. [483 F.3d at 84](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2011935029&pubNum=506&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=\(sc.Folder*cid.f3e7b9781c1d4983a1ee68d908331f50*oc.Keycite\)#co_pp_sp_506_84) (“\[i\]t is in th\[e\] context of \[the degree of the\] expectation of privacy that the government's intrusion on the defendant's interests must be considered”). In *Amerson*, the Second Circuit characterized probationers' expectations of privacy as “diminished—but far from extinguished.” *Id.* (citing [*Samson v. California,* 547 U.S. at 848–49;](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2009382690&pubNum=780&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=\(sc.Folder*cid.f3e7b9781c1d4983a1ee68d908331f50*oc.Keycite\)#co_pp_sp_780_848) [*United States v. Knights,* 534 U.S. 112, 119, 122 S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001)](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2001526222&pubNum=708&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=\(sc.Folder*cid.f3e7b9781c1d4983a1ee68d908331f50*oc.Keycite\)) delineating that reasonableness is judged on the basis of a three-part balancing test that examines (1) the nature of the privacy interest involve, (2) the character and degree of the governmental intrusion, and (3) the nature and immediacy of the government’s needs and the efficacy of its policy in addressing those needs).

   The Second Circuit has not directly addressed the reasonable expectations of privacy of non-convicted, indicted persons. Yet every single decision still valid to date has upheld the collection of DNA from people in custody or on release under the act. *See, e.g., United States v. Sczubelek,* 402 F.3d 175 (3d Cir. 2005); *United States v. Kincade,* 379 F.3d 813, 830-31 (9th Cir. 2004\) (en banc) (plurality opinion) (collecting cases), *cert. denied,* 2005 U.S. LEXIS 2505, 73 U.S.L.W. 3555 (2005); *Groceman v. United States,* 354 F.3d 411 (5th Cir. 2004\) (per curiam). *United States v. Kimler,* 335 F.3d 1132 (10th Cir. 2003); *United States v. Conlev,* 454 F.3d 674 (6th Cir. 2006); and *United States v. Hook,* 471 F.3d 766 (7th Cir. 2006).

   3. The swabbing of the DNA is a secondary governmental goal and as such valid. 

   The dichotomy between primary and secondary law enforcement objectives has also been close. In *Hook* the Seventh Circuit found that even when the goals of the program under the statue were all law enforcement-related that the program satisfied the special needs test. *Hook,* 471 F.3d at 773\. A simple desire to build a DNA database has also been found to be sufficient to go beyond the ordinary law enforcement need. *Kimler*, 335 at 1132\. The justification was the program’s purpose was to obtain identifying information and not to uncover evidence of wrongdoing or to solve a particular crime, which could not be done through normal channels of law enforcement. Id at 1146\. The most recent decision dealing with a pre conviction post arrest has affirmatively held the propriety of the DNA collection scheme*. Haskell v. Harris*, 2012 WL 589469 (9th Cir. 2012).

2. **Application of the Special Needs Test shows that the collection of DNA from pre conviction arrestees does not violate their fourth amendment protections.**  
   1. Arrestees have a minimal interest in the privacy of their DNA

   As with parolees and conditional releases, arrestees are not entitled to the full panoply of rights and protections possessed by the general public and are properly subjected to a broad range of restrictions *United States v. Kincade,* 379 F.3d at 843\. The second and “potentially much more serious invasion of privacy” is the “analysis and maintenance of \[DNA\] information” in CODIS. *Id.* at 835\. According to the Second Circuit, this intrusion is “significant” considering the “vast amount of sensitive information that can be mined from a person's DNA and the very strong privacy interests that *all* individuals have in this information.” *Id.* (emphasis added) (citing *United States v. Kincade,* 379 F.3d at 843 (Reinhardt, J., dissenting) (discussing concerns about the “profound social effects” of “allowing the government to collect and maintain private information about the intimate details of our lives”)). Yet the current DNA cheek swabbing can if characterized as an “invasion” can only be done so in very slight terms. 

   Past extraction of DNA also points to the minimal nature of the DNA swabbing. In past years, DNA samples were generally obtained by a blood draw from the arm. 73 Fed. Reg. at 74,935. But now, far less invasive procedures are used. Id. Indeed experts agree that When performed by buccal swab, “\[t\]he taking of bodily material for DNA testing is perhaps the least intrusive of all seizures--it involves no penetration of the skin, pain, or substantial inconvenience.” Jules Epstein, *“Genetic Surveillance”--The Bogeyman Response to Familial DNA Investigations*, 2009 U. Ill. J.L. Tech. & Pol'y 141, 152 (2009). This procedure is hardly invasive at all, especially when compared with drawing blood from the arm, which the Supreme Court and this Circuit have already recognized as minimally invasive. *See* *Skinner v. Ry. Labor Executives' Ass'n*, 489 U.S. 602, 625 (1989) (“the intrusion occasioned by a blood test is not significant” because the procedure is common and low-risk).

   2. The character and degree of the governmental intrusion is minimal. 

   To this regards, swabbing and extracting DNA is not any different than taking an individual’s fingerprints post arrest. *Kincade*, 379 F.3d at 837 (citing *Rise* with approval where it found that there is a constitutionally different protection for free persons and those that have been arrested). Other Second Circuit cases have also pointed to the minimum amount of intrusiveness inherent in swabbing. *United States v. Kincade,* 379 F.3d at 843\. (When considering the limits imposed on the collection, analysis and use of DNA information by the statue .. the intrusion on privacy effected by the statute is similar to the intrusion wrought by the maintenance of fingerprint records.)  

   Furthermore, despite concerns over the value of DNA information, the court determined that the statutes’ safeguards adequately “minimized” the privacy invasion occasioned by the DNA indexing. First, the court observed that the CODIS database stores only “junk DNA” sequences that are not “currently associated with any known physical or medical characteristics,” but rather “establish\[ \] only a record of the \[person's\] identity.” *Id.* Second, the court noted that the Act “severely limits” the purposes for which the samples can be used and imposes penalties for any misuse. Considering the federal DNA act’s requirement that law enforcement personnel obtain a DNA sample through a blood draw, this court has held that it is firmly established that the intrusion occasioned by a blood test is not significant. Moreover, the Act provides additional protections against abuse of the DNA coding system. The law instructs authorities to use and keep only those 13 specific markers used for identification, and it provides criminal penalties-- including up to a year in prison--for misuse of the collected information. *See*  42 U.S.C. § 14133 (federal criminal penalties for misuse of CODIS information).

   3. The government has a compelling interest in collecting samples for its DNA Database at the time of arrest under 18 U.S.C. § 111a.

   Arrestee information under 18 USC 111 will greatly improve identification of errant criminals as well as help the general public by solving and prevents crimes. The success of CODIS has been a function to the number of available profiles. By November 2009 the NDIS contained more than 7 million offender profiles with CODIS producing more than 100 thousand hits assisting in more than 100 thousand investigations. FBI, *CODIS \- NDIS Statistics* (www.fbi.gov/hq/lab/codis/clickmap.htm)

   Adding arrestee profiles can increase the number of hits that can solve crimes and prevent others. The practice of using arrestee profiles has already been in practice in the state of Virginia where as of 2009 there were more than 300 thousand DNA samples in their database resulting in more than 5 thousand hits, assisting investigators in addition to helping catch repeat offenders before they continue a pattern of violent crime. *See* Virginia, Department of Forensic Science, *DNA Databank Statistics* (www.dfs.virginia.gov/statistics/index.cfm). Furthermore, there have been studies that quantify the beneficial qualities of the DNA matching program. John K. Roman, *etal*, *The DNA Field Experiment: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the Use of DNA in the Investigation of High-Volume Crimes* 13 (Urban Inst. Justice Pol'y Ctr. 2008\) (showing that with every burglary conviction obtained through DNA matches there are an additional 7.4 crimes avoided). 

   The benefits of DNA identification have also been born out in more shocking cases. In Texas, a man who raped three women was released on bail. *See* Laylan Copelin, *Texas Legislature Expands Use of DNA Testing*, Cox News Service (June 8, 2001). Over the next six months he raped four more women before being arrested on burglary charges. Testing him upon his first burglary arrest could have led to a faster DNA match from his first three crimes. Id. The crimes included in 18 usc 111 are exactly of the same types of crimes that could lead to the prevention of much more harrowing crimes, effectuated through a process no more invasive than taking fingerprints. 

   A small expansion of CODIS will promote exoneration of the innocent and Reduces Unnecessary Investigations thereby increasing real protections against government incursion. \[citation\] Wrongful convictions are an acute problem in the criminal justice system, that with ever increasing legislation adding harsher minimum sentences to crimes have placed judges in a precarious situation. DNA matching through CODIS has already help exonerate many innocent people see *Charges Dismissed Against Child Rape, Murder Suspect: DNA Test Exonerates Gonzales In Victoria Sandoval Case* (June 27, 2008\) (www.koat.com/news/16732539/detail.html) (with the exoneration of a mentally handicapped man from New Mexico who was wrongfully convicted of three murders). 

   DNA identification reduces more gross invasions of privacy that result from inefficiencies and biases of the criminal justice system. Its categorization is even less invasive than fingerprints as DNA profiles are stored as numeric files without any personal information or criminal background. See DNA Initiative, *History of Forensic DNA Analysis*(www.dna.gov/basics/analysishistory) (stating that DNA is the silent biological weapon). Furthermore, it is proven that prosecutions based on DNA evidence are far more efficient because the evidence results in consolidated prosecution and more guilty pleas. See Jay Siegel & Susan D. Narveson, *Why Arrestee DNA Legislation Can Save Indiana Taxpayers Over $50 Million Per Year* at 9 (Jan. 2009). Ray A. Wickenheiser, *The Business Case for Using Forensic DNA Technology to Solve and Prevent Crime* 58 (www.dnaresource.com/documents/BusinessCaseforDNA.pdf).

   The Government has a compelling interest beyond law enforcement in enlarging the pool of participants to the CODIS system that is immediate. The governmental justification for \[DNA\] identification . . . relies on no argument different in kind from that traditionally advanced for taking fingerprints and photographs, but with additional force because of the potentially greater precision of DNA sampling and matching methods.” [*Sczubelek*, 402 F.3d at 185-86](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2006364056&pubNum=506&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=\(sc.Folder*cid.96921dd667a4409aaac4e0bab4739449*oc.RelatedInfo\)#co_pp_sp_506_185).  “As with fingerprints, the collection of DNA samples at or near the time of arrest. . . can serve purposes relating directly to the arrest and ensuing proceedings.” [73 Fed. Reg. at 74934](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=0341917167&pubNum=1037&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=\(sc.Folder*cid.96921dd667a4409aaac4e0bab4739449*oc.RelatedInfo\)#co_pp_sp_1037_74934).

   DNA identification also is much more effective than fingerprinting or name searching to determine if an arrestee is wanted elsewhere and to aid identification if he flees prosecution. [*Anderson*, 650 S.E.2d at 706](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2013180707&pubNum=711&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=\(sc.Folder*cid.96921dd667a4409aaac4e0bab4739449*oc.RelatedInfo\)#co_pp_sp_711_706). Thus, the government has a compelling interest in obtaining DNA identification information to process the arrestee for the immediate offense, regardless of whether it is able to learn a defendant's name by other means. It also has a compelling interest in accurately identifying the arrestee as the perpetrator of other crimes. Contrary to appellants' arguments, identification also includes associating the person with what he has done. [*Kincade*, 379 F.3d at 838](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=2004884635&pubNum=506&originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=\(sc.Folder*cid.96921dd667a4409aaac4e0bab4739449*oc.RelatedInfo\)#co_pp_sp_506_838) (noting the use of DNA profiling as identification that can be used to link perpetrators to crimes).

    All of these interest serve a secondary law enforcement goal. One need not look further than the facts of this case. Where the primary goal is to convict Ms. Park under 18 U.S.C. 111 statute that is denuded from the secondary goal of expanding the CODIS database. 

**CONCLUSION**  
	For the foregoing reasons and the fact that that 18 U.S.C. 111a is a crime of violence. The extraction of DNA for CODIS should be permitted as a condition for release.
