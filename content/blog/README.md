# Blog Posts

This directory contains the blog posts for the website. To add a new post:

1. Create a new `.md` file in this directory
2. Add front matter at the top of the file:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Your Post Title
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   tags: ['tag1', 'tag2']
   ---
   ```
3. Write your post content using markdown
4. Save the file - it will automatically be processed and published

The blog system supports standard markdown features including:
- Headers
- Lists
- Links
- Images
- Code blocks
- Bold and italic text

Posts are automatically sorted by date (newest first) and can be filtered by tags.
